# pyDMS
Python implementation of Data Mining Sharpener (DMS): a decision tree based algorithm for 
sharpening (disaggregation) of low-resolution images using high-resolution images. 
The implementation is mostly based on [Gao2012].

The DMS is trained with high-resolution data resampled to
    low resolution and low-resolution data and then applied 
    directly to high-resolution data to obtain high-resolution representation
    of the low-resolution data.
    
The implementation includes selecting training data based on homogeneity
    statistics and using the homogeneity as weight factor ([Gao2012], section 2.2),
    performing linear regression with samples located within each regression
    tree leaf node ([Gao2012], section 2.1), using an ensemble of regression trees 
    ([Gao2012], section 2.1), performing local (moving window) and global regressions and
    combining them based on residuals ([Gao2012] section 2.3) and performing residual 
    analysis and bias correction ([Gao2012], section 2.4)
    
Additionally, the Decision Tree regressor can be replaced by Neural Network regressor.
